# Milestone Project 1- A Cure for Sitting
## Purpose
A cure for sitting is a project looking to educate software developers on ways to combat the negative physical effects of sitting for long periods of time. This site will be focused towards those who have tried the conventional interventions such as workplace ergonomics and passive physical modalities like cupping and dry needling and who are still suffering with aches and pains. The site is intended to be an intro to a new, proven method of pain relief through breath work and movement with the intent of future participation in a workplace wellness workshop or webinar.

# User Experience Design
## Strategy
+ ### Design Strategy
  With an information heavy website designed to use education as an introduction to treatment, use of space around paragraphs would have to be used well to not overwhelm most users. Layout of accompanying images, videos and links would help break up the heavy reading experinece.
  The addition of practical elements is designed with the intent of giving the user a break from reading and a chance to try out the information just learnt.

+ ### Business Strategy
  The logo and name of the site "A Cure for Sitting" directly targets the user audience. As the user is guided down the page and start to implement the practical elements they will see the difference this approach to treating pain from long term sitting has versus traditional approaches. Its quicker, cheaper and less intrusive than other  modalities of treatment. The only drawback with this approach is it's not long lasting. That is where the program page comes in to offer an more robust treatment paln. If this is not enought then users are encouraged to sign up to a more intensive webinar or workshop to seek long lasting changes to physical health.

# Scope

+ The conception of this site was always easily implemtable. Through the use of established social medias from the site creator most of the practical content was readily available. 
+ Those suffering with back-pain generally go through the same channels of doctor referal to physio and templated exercises. The site was inteded to use education and a practical elements as a major source of adding value to the user to give acute relief to pain. 
+ The site was purposefully kept plane and clean in design to not distract the user from how easy it is to escape pain with the right methodology. 
+ The layout was designed to guide users through the home page first, trying out all the given methods. This would lead to a bigger commitment to a seperate program and so was put on a seperate page and kept even more simple.
+ All of this is planned to ultimately lead the user to sign-up to a future webinar or workshop with each section being a small step to buy-in towards this feature.

# Structure

  + The site is very simple and familiar to general webpage layout for ease of navigation. A consistent header and footer are used across all 3 pages with the smae font and color scheme for familiarity.
  + Content is kept visiable in all ratios to suit all devices from desktop to mobile screen. 
  + The addition of a sticky nav bar to take users to different internal sections of the home page will be included to reduce annoyance and also give them instant access to all three practical elements.
  + Any interactive aspects of the page such as navigation links and form input sections will change in color or appearence once interacted with to provide a secure user experience across the whole site.

  # Skeleton
  + Visualisation was the main structure behind the end layout and design of the site as it's quiet a simple and user-friendly approach by intent.
  + Value is established and built on throughout the whole layout of the home page.
  + A quick sketch with marker and plane paper was used to give a physical sense of the layout of the site for both desktop and mobile responsivness.

  # Surface
  + The finsihed product looks exaclty as conceptualised with only the instagram reel post image removed from the mobile screen responsive design to keep the site looking clean and simple when scrolling on a hand held device. This was replaced by adding an anchor element to the line of text directing towards the instagram post and decorating the text with an underline when the screen size is reduced below 620px in width.

    3.  ### Whole Body
        The final paragraph on the home page brings all the practical elements together and invites to user to get up and move. A link to an instagram post directed at conveying this message in a clever way is attatched and placed nicely next to this paragraph of text.

+ ### Outro
